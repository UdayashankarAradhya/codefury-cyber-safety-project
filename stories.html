                <h2 class="card-title"> The Fake KYC Update Scam</h2>
                <p class="card-text">A 59-year-old woman in Delhi received a WhatsApp message from someone pretending to be a bank official. The message claimed her KYC details were outdated and her account would be frozen. Panicked, she followed their instructions and downloaded an app they sent her. This app gave the scammers full remote access to her phone. Within hours, they had stolen ‚Çπ47 lakh from her savings.</p>

                 <h4 class="mt-3 text-danger">Lesson Learned:</h4>
                <p>Banks will **never** ask you to download an app or share personal details over WhatsApp to update your KYC. Always contact your bank directly through their official phone number or by visiting a branch if you receive such a message.</p>

                <h2 class="card-title">The Telegram "Easy Money" Job Scam</h2>
                <p class="card-text">A woman in Bantwal received a link on Telegram promising she could earn thousands of rupees daily just by sending messages. To get started, she had to complete "tasks" that required her to transfer small amounts of money, which they promised to return with a commission. Initially, they returned the money to build trust. But as the tasks required larger and larger payments, they stopped returning the funds. She lost over ‚Çπ1.7 lakh before realizing she would never be able to withdraw her "earnings."</p>

                <h4 class="mt-3 text-danger">Lesson Learned:</h4>
                <p>No legitimate job will ever ask you to pay money to get started or to complete tasks. If a job offer seems too good to be true, it is a scam.</p>

                <h2 class="card-title">The Online Romance & Investment Scam</h2>
                <p class="card-text">A man in Bengaluru, looking for a life partner online, connected with a woman on Instagram. After chatting for a few days, she introduced him to a "guaranteed high-return" Bitcoin investment platform. She convinced him to start with small amounts, and the website showed incredible profits. Trusting her, he invested more and more. When he tried to withdraw his money, the website demanded more fees. By the time he realized it was a scam, he had lost ‚Çπ44 lakh.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-3 text-danger">Lesson Learned:</h4>
                <p>Be extremely cautious of investment opportunities from people you've only met online. If an investment promises unusually high or guaranteed returns with no risk, it is almost certainly a scam.</p>
